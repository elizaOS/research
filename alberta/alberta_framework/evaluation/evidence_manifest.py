"""Versioned, machine-readable claim manifest for continual-learning evidence.

This module does not reinterpret scientific results and does not trust file
presence.  It invokes each versioned artifact's strict loader and validator,
checks the artifact against the repository's frozen claim contract, and records
one of five statuses:

``accepted``
    Scientific evidence is valid, contract-bound, and passed its frozen gate.
``valid-rejection``
    The artifact is internally valid but failed at least one frozen gate.
``not-run``
    The expected artifact is absent.
``invalid``
    Parsing, integrity, schema, provenance, or contract validation failed.
``verified-nonpromoting``
    A valid unit/smoke result; its type makes scientific promotion impossible.

The manifest is operational metadata, not a new scientific artifact or
signature.  Its SHA-256 fields identify the exact artifact and source bytes
that were inspected.  Unit and smoke records are structurally barred from
scientific promotion, even if their local validators pass.
An overall accepted status means only that every *listed narrow gate* passed;
it is explicitly not an Alberta Plan completion certificate.
